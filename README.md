# Quantego

## Quantego is a family of Lego models of IBM Quantum Computers

The first version of Quantego has been created by Mathilda Lahmann, as mentioned on LinkedIn in [December 2021](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6875070856679231488/) and in [April 2022](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6920362102687723520/).

Currrently, we feature two differnt versions:
A Lego mode of IBM Quantum System *One* made of 49 bricks and a model of IBM Quantum System *Two* made of 105 bricks. 

For each of the models, build instructions and a parts list is being made available. 
The instructions and the digital pictures and animations have been created with [bricklink studio](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/main.page) lego digital design software. Part numbers (3001, 4201, etc) are as on [bricklink](https://www.bricklink.com/). 

We expect to make a much more sophisticated model of IBM Quantum System Two - made of 1024 bricks - available very soon. Stay tuned.

### Parts List
Parts list can be found at the end of the build instructions file. You can also download [this json](Qunatego-Two-1024/Quantego-Two-1024_v3_PAB.json) and upload it on the official Lego Pick a Brick website of your Country ([example](https://www.lego.com/en-us/pick-and-build/pick-a-brick)) to purchase all the parts directly from Lego. Just upload the json by clicking on the "Upload List" button.

### Disclaimer
This 1024 parts model has been designed by Lego amateurs (not professional): due to its rather complex design, it could be subject to issues. Any feedback for improvement is welcome!


## Kits

A small internet shop provides complete kits of these models at [Quantego.biz](http://Quantego.biz). 


## RasQberry

In case you would like to build a **functional model** of the IBM Quantum System One quantum computer, based on 3D printing, a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) mini computer and [Qiskit](http://qiskit.org) (IBM's open source quantummm computing software framework), have a look at [rasqberry.org](http://rasqberry.org).
