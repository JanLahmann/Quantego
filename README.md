# Quantego

## Quantego is a family of Lego models of IBM Quantum Computers

The first version of Quantego has been created by Mathilda Lahmann, as mentioned on LinkedIn in [December 2021](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6875070856679231488/) and in [April 2022](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6920362102687723520/).

Currrently, we feature two differnt versions:
A Lego mode of IBM Quantum System *One* made of XX bricks and a model of IBM Quantum System *Two* made of YY bricks. 

For each of the models, build instructions and a parts list is being made available. 
The instructions and the digital pictures and animations have been created with the [stud.io](http://stud.io) lego digital design software. Part numbers (3001, 4201, etc) are as on [bricklink](https://www.bricklink.com/). 

We expect to make a much more sophisticated model of IBM Quantum System Two - made of 1024 bricks - available very soon. Stay tuned.
